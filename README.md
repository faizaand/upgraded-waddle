# Upgraded Waddle

Upgraded Waddle is our solution to Client #2's problem. The assignment is as follows.

```
Your client is a family that would like a standard frame applied to a large number of pictures that feature one or more of the family members. They want the composite image to be memorable and to incorporate some personalized symbol, image, or silhouette that represents the interests of the family member(s). The client enjoys abstract art as well and might like to see geometric shape incorporated in the imageâ€”drawn on, as a border, or as a mask.

The client enjoys participating in the creative process and will appreciate being offered a range of options (as a parameter) for one of the image operations you perform.
```

## Project Steps

- [x] Build iterator to go through all the files.
- [x] Apply a frame to each image and store it in a modified directory.
- [x] Apply a geometric shape as a mask to the images.
- [x] Apply a logo to each image, and the client can choose the logo they want.
- [ ] Save all the modifications to the directory.
- [x] Fancy GUI for the parameter selection.
- [ ] Add labels for title and instructions.
